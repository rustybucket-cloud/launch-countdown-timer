## My process

I built my app using React hooks. I used a SASS file to style the app.

I had a mobile-first workflow. I started by using mobile width, then expanded the screen width.

I started by creating a Counter component, which would be the top of the top, which displays the header and the countdown. I created a countdown component which would be each countdown block, days, hours, minutes, seconds. I created a links component which would have the icon links to social media.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with Dates in Javascript. I picked a random date, found the difference between dates, and used the date to run the count down.

I learned how to use SASS to organize CSS and use SASS variables for styling
